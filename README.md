# CPE321_PROJECT_GROUP3

## Project Description

This is a project designed to show the frontend and backend operations of a website. The website simply fetches the data from a third party database specified in the backend/server.js as https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users via a setup middleware, in JSON format and displays it appropriately.

The basic structure of data sent(or received) can be seen in frontend/interfaces.ts

To start the project locally(on VS Code) start up a live server via the Live Server extension and navigate to frontend/index.html.

To view the project online(remotely) go to the website:
